# 210FinalProject
The goal of this project would be to create a model that recommends the best times to post and which types of content are most likely to generate high engagement based on audience behavior patterns.
#The dataset for this project consists of my Instagram data, including post details (such as post type, caption, hashtags, and post time), follower, and engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, and saves), also my engagement like my comments, likes and views. Additionally, we will incorporate story data, including views and interactions, to further refine the recommendations.
The dataset will consist of several key components from my Instagram account:
Post Details: Information about the posts such as the post type (photo, video, carousel), caption, hashtags, and the time the post was made.
Engagement Metrics: Data on how your audience interacted with your posts, including likes, comments, shares, saves, as well as your own engagement with others (likes, comments, views).
Story Data: Information about your Instagram stories, including the number of views and interactions (replies, reactions, etc.), which will help refine engagement patterns further.

Project Idea and Plan:
The goal is to create a machine learning model that can identify patterns in the data and provide recommendations on:

Optimal Post Timing: The best times to post based on past engagement and audience activity.
Content Type Recommendations: The types of content (e.g., photos, videos, carousels) and post characteristics (e.g., captions, hashtags) that tend to generate the highest engagement.
Plan:
Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Gather all Instagram post, follower, and engagement data. Clean and preprocess the data, ensuring it is structured correctly for analysis (e.g., converting timestamps, encoding categorical variables like post type).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze engagement patterns based on different factors: time of day, day of the week, post type, hashtags used, etc. Identify trends that could guide your model's predictions.
Feature Engineering:

Extract features such as time of post, day of the week, post category, engagement history, and story interactions. Combine these with follower activity patterns (e.g., when they are most active).
Model Development:

Train machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, or neural networks) to predict engagement metrics based on the post details and timing. Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, and recall.
Recommendation System:

Build a recommendation system to suggest the best posting times and content types for maximum engagement based on learned patterns.
Model Evaluation and Deployment:

Test the model's predictions and recommendations on new posts to ensure they lead to higher engagement. Refine and iterate as needed.
